# HannaCodeDialog

A module for ProcessWire CMS/CMF. Provides a number of enhancements for working with Hanna Code tags in CKEditor. The main enhancement is that Hanna tags in a CKEditor field may be double-clicked to edit their attributes using core ProcessWire inputfields in a modal dialog.

Requires the Hanna Code module.

## Installation

[Install](http://modules.processwire.com/install-uninstall/) the HannaCodeDialog module using any of the normal methods.

For any CKEditor field where you want the "Insert Hanna tag" dropdown menu to appear in the CKEditor toolbar, visit the field settings and add "HannaDropdown" to the "CKEditor Toolbar" settings field.

## Module configuration

Visit the module configuration screen to set any of the following:

* Exclude prefix: Hanna tags named with this prefix will not appear in the CKEditor toolbar dropdown menu for Hanna tag insertion.
* Exclude Hanna tags: Hanna tags selected here will not appear in the CKEditor toolbar dropdown menu for Hanna tag insertion.
* Background colour of tag widgets: you can customise the background colour used for Hanna tags in CKEditor if you like.
* Dialog width: in pixels
* Dialog height: in pixels

## Features

### Insert tag from toolbar dropdown menu

Place the cursor in the CKEditor window where you want to insert your Hanna tag, then select the tag from the "Insert Hanna tag" dropdown.

### Edit tag attributes in modal dialog

Insert a tag using the dropdown or double-click an existing tag in the CKEditor window to edit the tag attributes in a modal dialog.

### Tags are widgets

Hanna tags that have been inserted in a CKEditor window are "widgets" - they have a background colour for easy identification, are protected from accidental editing, and can be moved within the text by drag-and-drop.

### Options for tag attributes may be defined

You can define options for a tag attribute so that editors must choose an option rather than type text. This is useful for when only certain strings are valid for an attribute and also has the benefit of avoiding typos.

Add a new attribute for the Hanna tag, named the same as the existing attribute you want to add options for, followed by "__options". The options themselves are defined as a string, using a pipe character as a delimiter between options. Example for an existing attribute named "vegetables":

    vegetables__options=Spinach|Pumpkin|Celery|Tomato|Brussels Sprout|Potato

You can define a default for an attribute as normal. Use a pipe delimiter if defining multiple options as the default, for example:

    vegetables=Tomato|Potato

### Dynamic options

Besides defining static options as above, you can use one Hanna tag to dynamically generate options for another. For instance, you could create a Hanna tag that generates options based on images that have been uploaded to the page, or the titles of children of the page.

Your Hanna tag that generates the options should **echo** a string of options delimited by pipe characters (i.e. the same format as a static options string).

You will probably want to name the Hanna tag that generates the options so that it starts with an underscore (or whatever prefix you have configured as the "exclude" prefix in the module config), to avoid it appearing as an insertable tag in the HannaCodeDialog dropdown menu.

Example for an existing attribute named "image":

    image__options=[[_images_on_page]]

And the code for the `_images_on_page` tag:

    <?php
    $image_names = array();
    $image_fields = $page->fields->find('type=FieldtypeImage')->explode('name');
    foreach($image_fields as $image_field) {
        $image_names = array_unique( array_merge($image_names, $page->$image_field->explode('name') ) );
    }
    echo implode('|', $image_names);

### Choice of inputfield for attribute

You can choose the inputfield that is used for an attribute in the dialog.

For text attributes the supported inputfields are `text` (this is the default inputfield for text attributes so it isn't necessary to specify it if you want it) and `textarea`. Note: any manual line breaks inside a textarea are removed because these will break the CKEditor tag widget.

Inputfields that support the selection of a single option are `select` (this is the default inputfield for attributes with options so it isn't necessary to specify it if you want it) and `radios`.

Inputfields that support the selection of multiple options are `selectmultiple`, `asmselect` and  `checkboxes`.

You can also specify a `checkbox` inputfield - this is not for attributes with defined options but will limit an attribute to an integer value of 1 or 0.

The names of the inputfield types are case-insensitive.

Example for an existing attribute named "vegetables":

    vegetables__type=asmselect

### Descriptions and notes for inputfields

You can add a description or notes to an attribute and these will be displayed in the dialog.

Example for an existing attribute named "vegetables":

    vegetables__description=Please select vegetables for your soup.
    vegetables__notes=Pumpkin and celery is a delicious combination.

## Notes

When creating or editing a Hanna tag you can view a basic cheatsheet outlining the HannaCodeDialog features relating to attributes below the "Attributes" config inputfield.

## Troubleshooting

HannaCodeDialog includes and automatically loads the third-party CKEditor plugins [Line Utilities](http://ckeditor.com/addon/lineutils) and [Widget](http://ckeditor.com/addon/widget). If you have added these plugins to your CKEditor field already for some purpose and experience problems with HannaCodeDialog try deactivating those plugins from the CKEditor field settings.
